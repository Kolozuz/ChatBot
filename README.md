# Jujomi
Welcome to Jujomi Project Repository.
You may be wondering what is this 'Jujomi' thing about, well, this is a lil project we came up with for SENA wich is where we(Abestruz89 and I) studied Software Development last year.
The objective with it is to apply al the knwoledge we've been gathering trough the last year to create a software solution in the form of a webpage.

The truth is the idea of this project has varied a lot since it's beginning, at first we wanted to make a chatbot, but we quickly realized that we were not
prepared for such thing and that it didn't have a long term life expectation, a chatbot served an actual purpouse if it complemented another thing, but it is basicaly useless by itself.
